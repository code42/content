##### New: Code42 Copy File To Ticketing System

- New: (Migrated from paid pack) Downloads a file from Code42 and attaches it to a ticketing system. This playbook uses Jira out-of-the-box, but you can swap it with a different Ticketing system and achieve the same result. For example, to use ServiceNow, change the command `jira-issue-upload-file` to be `servicenow-upload-file` and use the `id` parameter for `issueId` and `file_id` for `entryId`.

##### New: Code42 Suspicious Activity Action

- New: (Migrated from paid pack) Take corrective actions against a Code42 user found to be exposing file data.

##### New: Code42 Suspicious Activity Review

- New: (Migrated from paid pack) Detects suspicious activities of a user and allows a recipient to assess the results. Afterward, the playbook takes action on the user such as adding them to legal hold.
