## Overview
---

Code42 provides simple, fast detection and response to everyday data loss from insider threats by focusing on customer data on endpoints and the cloud to answer questions like:

* Where is my data?
* Where has my data been?
* When did my data leave?
* What data exactly left my organization?

This integration was integrated and tested with the fully-hosted SaaS implementation of Code42 and requires a Platinum level subscription.

## Use Cases
---

* Ingesting File Exfiltration alerts from Code42
* Management of Departing Employees within Code42
* General file event and metadata search
